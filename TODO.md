#### TODO:
* Inventory improvements:
    * ~~Full view~~
    * ~~Navigating in the inventory~~
    * Shortcuts
        * From the full view set the shortcuts, but if it's not the Player's
        Inventory, the Item need to be added, if the shortcut already had an Item,
        it has to be replaced with the other.
    * Remove items
    * More inventory types (chest, bag etc.) (inventory_player_display, inventory_display)
* Lighting/Light source:
    * Portable type
    * More tests
* Level JSON cache
* Improving the build process (maybe Cmake)
* Probability.items should be dynamic
* Timers for periodic executions
* Multiple panels
* Normalize the Player's speed

#### Possible optimizations:
* Sight point lookup
